# Next_Location
This project aims to predict the next GPS location (latitude and longitude) of a user based on their movement history using classical machine learning techniques.
Next Location Predictor is a machine learning project that forecasts a user's next GPS location (latitude and longitude) based on their historical movement data. It uses the Geolife Trajectories 1.3 dataset collected by Microsoft Research, which contains real-world GPS traces from multiple users over five years.

This project processes and analyzes the movement patterns using spatial and temporal features like time of day, direction, and distance from previous locations. A Random Forest Regression model is then trained to predict the next position, helping us understand and anticipate user mobility.

Key Features

Applies separate machine learning models for latitude and longitude prediction

Visualizes actual vs predicted locations using scatter plots

Allows user-defined input for real-time prediction

 Applications
Location-based recommendation systems

Smart navigation and route planning

Traffic pattern analysis

Urban planning and mobility forecasting
